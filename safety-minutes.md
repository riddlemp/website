You may have heard about safety minutes at nuclear companies, where every
meeting starts with some discussion of safety. Doing this demonstrates that your
organization is laser-focused on safety.

Safety minutes don't have to just be about nuclear safety. They can be about
household safety or emergency preparedness too.

It's hard to come up with new and useful safety minutes with so many meetings going
on. Thus, we often end up hearing the same old ones again and again.

This is a place
where we can list out a few of our favorites for sharing and collaboration.
